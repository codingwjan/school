# PC Hardware Components

This is a web application that provides a list of hardware components for building a PC. The list includes CPUs, motherboards, RAM, storage devices, graphics cards, and power supplies. The data is sourced from the Newegg API, which provides real-time product information.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you can use the `npx serve` command to serve the application on a local web server. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
`git clone https://github.com/codingwjan/pc-hardware-components.git`


2. Navigate to the project directory.
`cd pc-hardware-components`


3. Install the dependencies.
`npm install serve`


4. Insert your own API key. The API used in this project is YouTube v3 and the key needs to be placed in line 181 of the `main.js` file.


5. Serve the application on a local web server using `npx serve`.


6. Open the application in your web browser by navigating to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Note

This project is free to use for everyone. However, please note that the Newegg API requires an API key to access the data. You will need to sign up for an API key and insert it in line 8 of the `main.js` file.
